# Imitation Coding Quiz (Trilogy Skills Bootcamp: Week 06 - Challenge)

## Important Notes
As the course content this week was entirely in JavaScript, without directly editing the HTML or CSS files, I decided my personal goal for this challenge was to reflect what we had learnt by working purely in Javascript.

I named the project with the unique name "Imitation Coding Quiz" because of the irony that the quiz is testing if a human can behave like a machine, compared to the imitation game by Alan Turing in 1950 which performs the opposite.

## Description
As I proceed in my journey to becoming a front-end web developer, it’s likely that I will be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help me become familiar with these tests and give me a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s challenge was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.<a href="#references">*[1]*</a>

## Acceptance Criteria

Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * 
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears.
  * 
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock.

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
